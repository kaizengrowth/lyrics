        <h3>(Verse 1)</h3>
<p>Walkin’ under streetlights \n
Sweet tights, weeknights \n
Brothers hustling delights \n
Fistfights, fast flights \n
Roll your window down, love \n
I’m fond of found love \n
Fifty rose a round love \n
Tongue love, no glove \n

Drive me round the town, John \n
I need to time to rebound \n
The song in the background \n
Makes me want to weep now \n
See the city sleep now \n
The lights how they creep round \n
Lonely as the street clown \n
Cuz deep down they all frown</p>

<h3>(CHORUS)</h3>
<p>Street lamp gospel, prayer on my lips \n
Shivering shadows in a twilight kiss \n
Echoes on sidewalks, hollow as the breeze \n
Echoes in my bones as I fall to my knees \n
Lonely as the dawn draping over city streets \n
Washing out the night as it seeps into my feet \n
Oh the yellow light is flowing over me \n
All I have, my heart, is a glowing honesty</p>

<h3>(Verse 2 )</h3>
<p>Walkin’ under streetlights \n
Freak sights, weak bites \n
Sisters hustling delights \n
Deep heights, fist right \n
Tell me what you want, man \n
I can’t stand a gaunt man \n
Fifty rose a flaunt, friend \n
Tongue, hand, wrong end \n
Drive me round the town, John \n
I need to time to rebound \n
The song in the background \n
Makes me want to weep now \n
See the city sleep now \n
The lights how they creep round \n
Lonely as the street clown \n
Cuz deep down they all frown</p>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<h3>(Verse 3)</h3>
<p>J:   Girl, you have cold hands \n
Ghost hands, hold hands \n
K:  I’ve got a lot of plans \n
Freelance, far lands \n
J:  You sink in quicksand \n
The nights end a nightstand \n
K:  But I know a knight and \n
He might be my Tarzan \n
J: Pray on your stars then \n
K:  I’ll be your star-send \n
J:  I’ve got my scars, friend \n
K:  I’ll be your scar’s end \n
J:   I’ll be your home \n
K:   Me? I’ll be your homey \n
Both:  I hope you can hold me \n
The sunrise is holy</p>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<p>Street lamp gospel, prayer on my lips \n
Shivering shadows in a twilight kiss \n
Echoes on sidewalks, hollow as the breeze \n
Echoes in my bones as I fall to my knees \n
Lonely as the dawn draping over city streets \n
Wash away the night as it seeps into my feet \n
Oh the yellow light is flowing out of me \n
All I have, my heart, is a glowing honesty</p>
