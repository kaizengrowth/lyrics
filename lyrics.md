(Verse 1)
Walkin’ under streetlights
Sweet tights, weeknights
Brothers hustling delights
Fistfights, fast flights
Roll your window down, love
I’m fond of found love
Fifty rose a round love
Tongue love, no glove
Drive me round the town, John
I need to time to rebound
The song in the background
Makes me want to weep now
See the city sleep now
The lights how they creep round
Lonely as the street clown
Cuz deep down they all frown

(CHORUS)
Street lamp gospel, prayer on my lips
Shivering shadows in a twilight kiss
Echoes on sidewalks, hollow as the breeze
Echoes in my bones as I fall to my knees
Lonely as the dawn draping over city streets
Washing out the night as it seeps into my feet
Oh the yellow light is flowing over me
All I have, my heart, is a glowing honesty

(Verse 2 )
Walkin’ under streetlights
Freak sights, weak bites
Sisters hustling delights
Deep heights, fist right
Tell me what you want, man
I can’t stand a gaunt man
Fifty rose a flaunt, friend
Tongue, hand, wrong end
Drive me round the town, John
I need to time to rebound
The song in the background
Makes me want to weep now
See the city sleep now
The lights how they creep round
Lonely as the street clown
Cuz deep down they all frown

CHORUS

(Verse 3)
J:   Girl, you have cold hands
Ghost hands, hold hands
V:  I’ve got a lot of plans
Freelance, far lands
J:  You sink in quicksand
The nights end a nightstand
V:  But I know a knight and
He might be my Tarzan
J: Pray on your stars then
V:  I’ll be your star-send
J:  I’ve got my scars, friend
V:  I’ll be your scar’s end
J:   I’ll be your home
V:   Me? I’ll be your homey
Both:  I hope you can hold me
The sunrise is holy

CHORUS
Street lamp gospel, prayer on my lips
Shivering shadows in a twilight kiss
Echoes on sidewalks, hollow as the breeze
Echoes in my bones as I fall to my knees
Lonely as the dawn draping over city streets
Wash away the night as it seeps into my feet
Oh the yellow light is flowing out of me
All I have, my heart, is a glowing honesty
